CSSPageFlip
===========

A demo CSS Page Flipper

This CSS demonstrates the most simplistic way to markup a 3d "page" and a flipping animation.


Right now the code itself does not actually work on anything outside of webkit, however once someone adds in the proper CSS modifications (-webkit, -moz, -ms, -o, etc) then it will work everywhere CSS 3D transitions are supported.
